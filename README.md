## ATL - PROJECT #1

For your first project you'll build an app from one of the following:

- Tic-Tac-Toe or a variant of it (Super-Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4)
- Hangman
- Jeopardy
- Simple Arcade Game (Duck Hunt) 

The objectives of this project are:

* Practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript/jQuery
* Solidify front-end skills by prototyping and building a site using HTML and CSS
* Practice app deployment



You will be working **individually** for this first project, but we'll be giving you direction this time. Show us what you've got!

<br>

##PROJECT CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app:

* Use HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript/jQuery with DOM manipulation
* Use Yeoman, Grunt, Bower
* Must be deployed

<br>


## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* Implement multiple games on your site (you can add a RPS if you wish)
* Keep score
* Make it responsive
* Add A.I. (player vs. computer)
* Add avatar choices for the player 
* Artificial Intelligence

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* Wireframes -- what does the app look like?
* Mock-ups (optional)
* Stories in Trello -- what do your objectives look like, broken down into unit-sized chunks?
* GitHub -- create a repo for your app and show that you've been commiting early and often, while utilizing clear commit messages.


####Completed Project deliverables (Due ***Wednesday 8/26***):

* Present your project Monday morning
* Link to Trello Board
* Link to Deployed App
* Link to Wirefames (photos will work too!)
* Link to mock-ups (if applicable)
* Link to source code on GitHub

## TIMELINE

* Project cycle: Mon 12/14 - Wed 12/16
* Due Date: ***Wednesday 12/16***

## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code is:

* **Well-formatted.** Are you indenting well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Sufficiently commented.** Will I understand what is going on in each block or function? If it's not clear, are there comments that indicate what you're doing?
* **Clear.** Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Time Management.** Focus on core requirements (minimum viable product) before spending a lot of time on "bells and whistles."

We'll also be looking at:

* **Quality of communication around decision-making.** Can you defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you think through alternative implementations?
* **Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself.** How did you approach any new libraries/technologies and extend your learning into a working game?
